# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/gamedev44
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `failure-is-fatal-life-or-death` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: "Intense scenario-based training simulator for nursing students"
5. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/gamedev44/failure-is-fatal-life-or-death.git
git push -u origin main
```

Or if you prefer SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:gamedev44/failure-is-fatal-life-or-death.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: I can set it up for you

If you provide the repository name you want, I can prepare the commands for you to run.
